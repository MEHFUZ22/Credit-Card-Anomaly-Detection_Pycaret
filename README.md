<H><strong>Credit-Card-Anomaly-Detection_Pycaret
Overview:</strong><H>
This project is a credit card anomaly detection system built using PyCaret, a Python library for automated machine learning. The goal of this project is to identify fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using machine learning algorithms.

<strong>Dataset:</strong>
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">dataset</a> from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset has 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the fraudulent transactions accounting for only 0.17% of the total transactions.

<strong>Installation:</strong>
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed, along with the following libraries:

<li>PyCaret</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>seaborn</li>
<li>scikit-learn</li>

<strong>Result:</strong>
The results of this project show that machine learning algorithms can effectively identify fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset, even in the presence of imbalanced classes. The best-performing algorithm was the Random Forest algorithm, which achieved an AUC score of 0.9379 and a recall score of 0.7625.
